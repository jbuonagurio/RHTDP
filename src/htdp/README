The Fortran-90 files in this directory were generated from the original 
HTDP v3.2.5 source code (htdp.for) using the fsplit utility, included 
with NetBSD: 

http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/usr.bin/fsplit/ 

Only the subroutines necessary for displacement and velocity 
calculations are included. The subroutines IYMDMJ, MODEL, NEWCOR, PREDV, 
SETRF and SETTP have been patched to use the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic 
module for better C interoperability. All other subroutines are 
unmodified from the original source. 

A standalone makefile is included to build a static library.
