The Fortran-90 files in this directory were generated from the original 
HTDP v3.2.5 source code (htdp.for) using the fsplit utility, included 
with NetBSD: 

http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/usr.bin/fsplit/ 

Only the subroutines necessary for displacement and velocity 
calculations are included. The following subroutines have been patched 
to use the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module for better C interoperability: 

IYMDMJ, MODEL, NEWCOR, PREDV, SETRF, SETTP

See the following commit for details: 

https://github.com/jbuonagurio/RHTDP/commit/76d729bfc67a7881ec80939dc2ee12b061ae5663

The following subroutines have been patched to replace Fortran I/O 
(WRITE and STOP statements) with R-only versions of error and warning 
(REXIT, RWARN) as required by CRAN: 

COMVEL, PLATVL, POLYIN, VTRANF, VTRANF_IERS, XTO08

REXIT and RWARN are defined in src/main/xxxpr.f in the R sources. These 
subroutines should be replaced for any other use of the HTDP library. 
See the following commit for details: 

https://github.com/jbuonagurio/RHTDP/commit/28f1bdfcfb86d1527ce2ef050095975cf0fa9233

All other subroutines are unmodified from the original source. 

A sample makefile is included to build a static library.
